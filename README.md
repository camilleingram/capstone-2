- **Checkout**: Order finalization and receipt generation

### File Management
- **Receipt Storage**: Orders are automatically saved as text files in `src/main/receipts/`

## Interesting Implementation Details

### Sandwich Builder Pattern
One of the most interesting aspects of this project is the implementation of the Builder pattern for sandwich construction. Initially, I attempted to use an empty constructor for the Sandwich class and add components as the user made selections. However, this approach proved problematic because it required the sandwich object to be in an incomplete state during construction.

The Builder pattern solved this elegantly by:
- Allowing step-by-step construction without exposing incomplete objects
- Providing flexibility for optional components (toppings, sauces)
- Enabling modification of selections before final construction
- Maintaining immutability of the final Sandwich object

This pattern is particularly effective for complex objects like sandwiches where customers can make numerous optional selections in any order.

### Pricing Architecture
The application uses a consistent `Priceable` interface across all purchasable items, enabling polymorphic price calculations. Each item type implements its own pricing logic:
- Size-based pricing for sandwiches and drinks
- Extra portion calculations for premium toppings
- Flat pricing for chips and regular toppings

## Future Enhancements

- **GUI Interface**: Replace console interface with graphical user interface
- **Database Integration**: Store customer and order data persistently
- **Online Ordering**: Web-based ordering system
